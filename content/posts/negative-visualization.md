Hedonistic adaptation is the human ability to normalizeÂ just about *anything*. This means that even after  positive experiences or achievements, our sense of satisfaction tends to fade as we adapt to the new circumstances.

Hedonistic adaptation can actually be beneficial in negative circumstances, allowing us to normalize worsening situations without constantly feeling pain or distress (which, in itself, could arguably be a negative, such as in the case of boiled frog syndrome). The downside, though, is that it works both ways; it can  turn your lottery winnings into  the "new normal", leaving you yearning for more instead of feeling content.

# Negative Visualization

Negative visualization is a Stoic practice that helps counteract hedonistic adaptation. Interestingly, it also has parallels with some cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises, where imagining worst-case scenarios can help reduce anxiety and manage negative emotions. By preparing ourselves for possible challenges, we can decrease their emotional impact. &#x20;

The goal of negative visualization is to trick our brain into wanting the things we already have again. By mentally picturing losing the people and things we value, we  appreciate them more deeply and reduce the inclination to take them for granted. This practice helps us to manage expectations, reducing the emotional blow when setbacks or loss occurs, having already prepared ourselves for  adversity.

Negative visualization is also a powerful method for cultivating gratitude. Gratitude can be challenging, especially if you're not used to practicing it. We overlook the things we should be grateful for because hedonistic adaptation causes us take them for granted. We may not even be aware of it! Instead, perhaps we have a general sense of dissatisfaction with our lives and accomplishments. By visualizing their absence or loss, we can reframe our perspective and start to remember their true value.

# Practices

## Imagining Inconvenience

A recent situation where I put negative visualization into practice was before a concert that I wasn't sure  I'd enjoy. With ADHD, the worst-case scenario  would have been sitting still for hours with nothing to do, unable to leave politely, and having to endure each excruciating moment of boredom, unable to ignore the distraction of the concert to think about other things. On the drive to the concert, I imagined exactly that: sitting there, feeling restless, bored, and trapped.

As a result, when the concert turned out to be better than expected, my emotional response was surprisingly exuberant. I ended up enjoying the concert and had a wonderful evening. Without  visualization beforehand, I likely would have been more negatively predisposed  to enjoying the experience. Instead, I enjoyed a memorable evening with my family and even discovered a new band.

## Imagining Major Setbacks in Your Life

Negative visualization can help prepare you for major setbacks. These could include losing your job, your 16-year-old popping one of the brand-new tires you just bought for your car, or a rock cracking your windshield (which you also just paid to replace)... just to name a few recent examples from my own life.

At my last job, I was lucky enough to get a quiet warning ahead of time that I'd be affected by the next round of layoffs. Because I had time to visualize this happening and prepare my mind for it, the actual event wasn't nearly as devastating as it could have been. Since my expectations had already been adjusted, I wasn't disappointed or shocked.

Instead of panicking, I focused my energy on applying for new jobs and honing skills that I thought would make me more attractive in the job market. Eventually, I found a very rewarding position. Like every other layoff I've experienced, this one turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The fact that I was emotionally prepared  for it, even unintentionally, meant that I was able to treat it as an opportunity rather than a misfortune.

## Imagining Loss

Imagining significant losses, such as losing a loved one, a close friend, or a beloved pet, is one of the most challenging aspects of negative visualization. It involves picturing someone you deeply care about dying or otherwise being removed from your life. While it may seem counterintuitive, it ultimately helps foster gratitude for the time you have with them now.

Maybe this practice will help me manage my shock if such a loss occurs; I haven't yet experienced a major loss since beginning to practice negative visualization. But I do know that it helps me focus on gratitude and making the most of my relationships. For example, imagining my daughter growing up and never wanting to speak to me again helps me reframe my interactions with her. Instead of allowing my impatience or frustration to show during her more *teenage* moments, I try to consider the kind of relationship I hope to have with her when she's an adult. This helps me stay present and grateful for our interactions, knowing they won't last forever. To paraphrase Seneca, nothing in our life truly belongs to us; it is instead on loan from Fortune, who may reclaim it at any moment, without warning.

# Conclusion

Negative visualization is a powerful tool for navigating the ups and downs of life. By imagining inconveniences, setbacks, and personal losses, we learn to better appreciate what we have and prepare ourselves mentally for adversity. This practice strengthens our resilience, reduces the emotional impact of negative events, and helps us focus on gratitude in our everyday lives. Instead of becoming complacent or taking our blessings for granted, negative visualization reminds us that everything is fleeting and encourages us to live more fully in the present.

It took me months of practice to gradually get to the point where I didn't feel silly practicing gratitude and feeling appreciative for "trivial" things in my life. But I've come to understand that these minor acts of gratitude are what it means to be happy in life. In a society that emphasizes the constant pursuit of *more*, practicing negative visualization is a way to nurture contentment and deepen our appreciation for what is already within our reach.
